              Life is a very precious gift and I feel it should be protected so, I am Pro-Life with a few exceptions: 
        Rape, Incest, Protecting the Life of the Mother and in some serious cases birth defects. </p>

            Medicare-for-all/for-all-who-want-it
          </h3>
          <p>
             I feel as though this would cripple the economy and the United States as a whole especially, the health-care industry.
            Health Professionals salaries will drop heavily and there would be a high need for these professionals. Along with the
            high-increase of taxes and long-waits as seen in Canada, UK, etc etc.

            Transparency
          </h3>
          <p>
            We need price transparency within the industry in order to protect the consumers and keep the trust within the healthcare
            system. Same with malpractice -- we need transparency in that regard and limit the repercussions for minor mistakes so, 
            those who have made mistakes can come clean and upfront with the patient.
          </p>

            Prescription Drug Prices
          </h3>
          <p>
            Drug prices are rising in the US compared to other places around the world -- I feel we need to lower the drug prices 
            significantly and create some sort of agreement with other nations to get the lowest prices on drugs for the American 
            people.

            Animal Cruelty
          </h3>
          <p>
            Animal Cruelty should be made a federal felony as, animals should have to not go through extreme acts of cruelty or any
            punishment including sexual abuse.
