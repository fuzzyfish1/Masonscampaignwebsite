              Life is a very precious gift and I feel it should be protected so, I am Pro-Life with a few exceptions: 
        Rape, Incest, Protecting the Life of the Mother and in some serious cases birth defects. </p>

            Medicare-for-all/for-all-who-want-it
          </h2>
          <p>
             I feel as though this would cripple the economy and the United States as a whole especially, the health-care industry.
            Health Professionals salaries will drop heavily and there would be a high need for these professionals. Along with the
            high-increase of taxes and long-waits as seen in Canada, UK, etc etc.

            Transparency
          </h2>
          <p>
            We need price transparency within the industry in order to protect the consumers and keep the trust within the healthcare
            system. Same with malpractice -- we need transparency in that regard and limit the repercussions for minor mistakes so, 
            those who have made mistakes can come clean and upfront with the patient.

            Prescription Drug Prices
          </h2>
          <p>
            Drug prices are rising in the US compared to other places around the world -- I feel we need to lower the drug prices 
            significantly and create some sort of agreement with other nations to get the lowest prices on drugs for the American 
            people.
