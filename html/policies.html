              Life is a very precious gift and I feel it should be protected so, I am Pro-Life with a few exceptions: 
        Rape, Incest, Protecting the Life of the Mother and in some serious cases birth defects. </p>

             I feel as though this would cripple the economy and the United States as a whole especially, the health-care industry.
            Health Professionals salaries will drop heavily and there would be a high need for these professionals. Along with the
            high-increase of taxes and long-waits as seen in Canada, UK, etc etc.
